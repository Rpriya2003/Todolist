This is a simple console-based To-Do List application** built using Python. It allows users to manage their daily tasks directly from the command line. 
The program provides options to **view all tasks, add new tasks, remove existing tasks, and exit. 
All tasks are stored in a text file (`tasks.txt`), so they are saved permanently even after closing the program. 
When the program starts, it loads any existing tasks from the file, and whenever a task is added or removed, the changes are saved back to the file. 
This makes the application easy to use and ensures tasks are not lost between sessions.
